# hello-world

I'm not sure what to write here.

I don't have much coding experience, however I am very motivated.
Until now, all I've done is follow some courses on CodeCademy.com .

I've finished the following:
    HTML/CSS
    The Command Line
    Java
    Python

However, I assume these courses are pretty basic.

I'd like to get better at coding, to be able to write serious programs.
At the moment I'm working my way through a programming book on 'C' and in one of my short breaks I was wondering about GitHub.
So here I am!

Cheers!
